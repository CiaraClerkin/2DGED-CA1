CA1 for 2D Game Engine Development module

### The Original Game Idea
I know I probably shouldn't add more after the presentation, but I wanted to say this during the presentation, but everytime I explained my game idea to others in words, I would fumble it somehow so I didn't. 

Originally, you would play as someone who does food deliveries where the business' motto is "We'll deliver in 60 seconds - or it's free!". In order to make these fast deliveries, you play as a speedy parkourist who can effortlessly jump and scale walls to reach appartment rooms from their balconies.

It's basically an endless type game where delivery points spawn on appartment balconies, each with their own 60 second timer. If you don't manage to touch a delivery before its timer runs out, it's game over. There would also be a score counter for how many packages were delivered.

I was also thinking of having the player go back to a base to gather the food for deliveries, like a little bit of a break and adds to the realism of making deliveries.

I love this idea. I was really disappointed that I couldn't do it. It's like Ship Shape from A Hat In Time, Crazy Taxi and Mirror's Edge had a 2D baby.
